    <p>Hello! You might be wondering why did I decide to create this website I created this website to spread awwareness over this issue.In my website you can find a page where you can donate to help countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also you can find a contact page if you have any questions or suggestion.There is also a home page where you can find basic information. Also this is effecting many animals and causing them to go instinct.Humans are causing this world issue by consuming too much and buring fossil fuel. </p>
